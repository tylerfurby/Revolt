# The Revolt App

- Alright so… sweet. I got the app on GitHub finally… the address for the GitHub Repository is: https://github.com/tylerfurby/Revolt.git

- Now, here are some thing you will need to download to get the full revolt.xcodeproj to function 100% properly…
- smoke.mov,  basictitlefont.ttf, revoltsymbol.png
- I will send them over email or Facebook Messenger or something…
- After you get these 3 files, you will need to simply just drag them to the _Revolt Folder_ in the Project Navigator.

- Aside from that, once you are in Xcode there are a couple frameworks you need to include…
- First, simply click on the very upmost blue paper looking picture on the project navigator, the one labeled Revolt
- Second, under the general tab, go down to _Linked Frameworks and Libraries_
- Go ahead and hit that little plus sign and add the following:
  - MediaPlayer.framework
  - AVFoundation.framework

- After doing all of this - the app should be up an running.
- A couple notes:
	- _The app is made to run on a 4.7 inch iPhone_
	- _It only runs on iOS 7 and above as of now (which is iOS 7, iOS 8, and iOS 9)_
